# Project name : "Safety-first Road System"
After months of hard work, dedication, and collaborative brilliance, we successfully presented and defended our Graphics project with flying colors. Gratitude to our exceptional team for their hard work and dedication. 
Onward to new milestones and opportunities! ðŸ“Œ
NB: The first scenario includes Traffic Sound

## Introduction:
The primary objective of this graphical project is to develop a safety road system tailored for emergency situations. The project encompasses user engagement with dynamic elements, including but not limited to, car movement, firing effects, emergency response vehicles, traffic signal
transitions, day-night cycles, and an interactive gate. Its overarching goal is to showcase the prowess  of OpenGL in constructing visually compelling and immersive 2D graphics simulations.
